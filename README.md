# Areality

## Basis

* **areal** objects of
    * **sight** ~ reflection of **wave**
    * **touch** ~ collision of **wave**
    * **sound** ~ vibration of **wave**

* **areal** objects of
    * **sight** ~ collision of **microwave**
    * **touch** ~ collision of **megawave**
    * **sound** ~ collision of **macrowave**

**(sight, touch, sound) ~ spectacular**

Is this right?

Sure. It's areality.

So, areality is just a compoisition of prior ideas and a duplication of
many present ones.

Some random ideas which might die at the moment of birth or might lead
to something encodable:

* There is no such notion as **order**
* There is no such notion as **all**
* There is no such notion as **absolute**
* **spectacular** can perform **action** **observe** under itself and
    any **areal object** in the **areal universe**
* **action** is just a tuple of **(sight, touch, sound)**
* **action** being done never stops until the end of **the areal universe**
* There is no such notion as **always** and **never**

I extracted all these statements from my common sense. I have no idea why I
find them importand enough to be placed here.

They're just the **rules** of **areality**.
